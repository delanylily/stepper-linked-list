# Double Linked List
This project was created to extend the concept of a singly linked list and use it in practice. I have used a linked list structure to enable efficient navigation in both forward and backward travesal. It is a generic component so can be used in other projects where you need to frequently move in both directions. 

### Features
- Insertions and Deletions- when deleting a noce, you can directly update the pointers of the adjacent nodes
- Selection of element by index
-  Conversion of the list to an Array for use within the UI

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
